<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Every browser accepts a string from the user and then displays a web page. The string from the user is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and looks something like this: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com</a>. After receiving the URL, the browser has a lot of work to do, but in a nutshell, this work can be described as finding the web page. The web page is located somewhere on the Internet, and the browser has to retrieve it. Since the <code class="java">https://www.</code> part is always the same, it is often omitted and the link is shortened to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">google.com</a>.</p>

<p>In our first stage, we'll try to imitate this behavior.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>You should write a program that takes a string from the user (URL) and outputs a "hard-coded" website with news (just a header and some text below).<br>
	The websites are presented as two variables in source code; you can see them in the template. These are mock versions of the sites <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">bloomberg.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">nytimes.com</a>. You just need to output them as a response to the corresponding input URL. </li>
	<li>
	<p>Also, you should add the option to quit the browser by typing <code class="java">exit</code>. Real browsers don’t finish their work when they output a single web page, they are ready to accept a new URL at any moment. You should implement this behavior, too. An endless loop can help you with that part.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
